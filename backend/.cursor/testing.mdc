- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert structure.
- Name test variables with intent (inputX, expectedX, etc.).
- Write unit tests for each public function.
- Use mocks and stubs for dependencies.
- Write acceptance tests for each module.
- Use Given-When-Then for test structure.
- For Fastify:
  - Use `inject()` for E2E tests.
  - Add `/health` endpoint per module for smoke tests.
